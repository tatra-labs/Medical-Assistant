# Medical-Assistant

A medical question-answering system utilizing the provided [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1upzfj8bXP012zZsq01jcoeO9NyhmTHnQ/view?usp=drive_link) containing medical information. The goal is to create a model that can effectively answer user queries related to medical diseases. You are free to augment the provided dataset with other medical datasets if you feel it is necessary.

## Tasks 

### Data Preprocessing:

Ensure the data is structured appropriately for model training, validation, and testing.

### Model Training:

Develop a machine learning model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user queries. Choose an appropriate architecture for the model, considering factors such as the complexity of the dataset and the computational resources available.

### Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics. State your reasoning for using the metric.

### Example Interaction:

Include at least three example interactions where the user asks a question (something similar to the provided dataset), and the model provides an answer.

### Documentation:

Provide a README file with a concise description of the approach used to tackle the problem. Include:
- Details about any assumptions made during model development and training. 
- Model's performance, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses. 
- Potential improvements or extensions to the solution, such as refining the model architecture, etc.
